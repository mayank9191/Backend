// MIDDLEWARE => A middleware in Express.js is a function that runs between the request (req) and response (res) cycle. It can modify the request, process data, and decide whether to pass control to the next middleware.

// To define a Middlleware() or a router in express we uses app.use()
// some common middleware are:

// cors() => allow cross origin to access there resources 
// express.json() => allow express to parse incomming JSON request bodies
// express.static() => serves static files from folder name specified 
// express.urlencoded() => used to parse a incomming url-encoded form data helps in handdling form submission in express app and extends true takes in key,value pair

// cookieParser() =>  parses cookies from incoming HTTP requests and makes them available in req.cookies

// cors() â†’ This is middleware that allows your backend to handle requests from different origins (domains).
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN, // it specifies which frontend domains are allowed to make requests
  credentials: true  //This enables the backend to handle cookies and authentication headers.
}))
