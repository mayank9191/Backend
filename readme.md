# Learning Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB

## Overview

I have learned **Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB**, which are essential technologies for backend development. This knowledge enables me to build scalable and efficient web applications using the MERN stack.

---

## Technologies Covered

- **Node.js** → JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js** → Minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB** → NoSQL database for storing and managing data efficiently.
- **Mongoose** → ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js.
- **MongoDB Atlas** → Cloud database service for MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary** → Cloud-based image and file storage solution.
- **Multer** → Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.
- **Cookie Parser** → Middleware to parse cookies in requests.
- **CORS** → Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** → Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt** → Library for password hashing and security.

## What I Learned

### 🔹 Node.js

- Setting up a Node.js project with `npm init`
- Handling asynchronous operations with **callbacks, promises, and async/await**
- Working with built-in modules like `fs`, `http`, and `path`

### 🔹 Express.js

- Creating a simple Express server
- Routing: Handling **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** requests
- Middleware functions (custom, built-in, third-party like `cors`, `morgan`)
- Error handling and custom error classes

### 🔹 MongoDB & Mongoose

- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB using Mongoose
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Schema and Model creation
- Using MongoDB Aggregation and `$lookup` for complex queries
- Storing data on **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database Service)**
- Implementing **Aggregation Pipeline** for advanced data processing

### 🔹 Authentication & Security

- User authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- Hashing passwords using **Bcrypt**
- Handling cookies using **Cookie Parser**
- Managing CORS policies with **CORS middleware**

### 🔹 File Upload & Storage

- Uploading and handling images using **Multer**
- Storing and serving images using **Cloudinary**

- Change Current Password
- Get Current User
- Update Account Details
- Update User Avatar
- Update User Cover Image
- Get User Channel Profile
- Get User Watch History

### 📹 Video Management

- Upload, update, and delete videos
- Fetch video details and metadata
- Stream videos efficiently
- Implement **likes, comments, and views tracking**

### 💬 User Engagement Features

- **Likes & Dislikes** on videos and comments
