# Learning Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB

## Overview

I have learned **Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB**, which are essential technologies for backend development. This knowledge enables me to build scalable and efficient web applications using the MERN stack.

---

## Technologies Covered

- **Node.js** → JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js** → Minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB** → NoSQL database for storing and managing data efficiently.
- **Mongoose** → ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js.
- **MongoDB Atlas** → Cloud database service for MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary** → Cloud-based image and file storage solution.
- **Multer** → Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.
- **Cookie Parser** → Middleware to parse cookies in requests.
- **CORS** → Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** → Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt** → Library for password hashing and security.

## What I Learned

### 🔹 **Node.js**

- Setting up a Node.js project with `npm init`
- Handling asynchronous operations with **callbacks, promises, and async/await**
- Working with built-in modules like `fs`, `http`, and `path`

### 🔹 **Express.js**

- Creating a simple Express server
- Routing: Handling **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** requests
- Middleware functions (custom, built-in, third-party like `cors`, `morgan`)
- Error handling and custom error classes

### 🔹 **MongoDB & Mongoose**

- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB using Mongoose
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Schema and Model creation
- Using MongoDB Aggregation and `$lookup` for complex queries
- Storing data on **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database Service)**
- Implementing **Aggregation Pipeline** for advanced data processing

### 🔹 **Authentication & Security**

- User authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- Hashing passwords using **Bcrypt**
- Handling cookies using **Cookie Parser**
- Managing CORS policies with **CORS middleware**

### 🔹 **File Upload & Storage**

- Uploading and handling images using **Multer**
- Storing and serving images using **Cloudinary**

  - **Refresh Access Token**
  - **Change Current Password**
  - **Get Current User**
  - **Update Account Details**
  - **Update User Avatar**
  - **Update User Cover Image**
  - **Get User Channel Profile**
  - **Get User Watch History**

- **Video Management**

  - Upload, update, and delete videos
  - Fetch video details and metadata
  - Stream videos efficiently
  - Implement **likes, comments, and views tracking**

- **User Engagement Features**

  - **Likes & Dislikes** on videos and comments
  - **Playlists** for organizing favorite videos
  - **Tweets-style posts** for user interactions

- **Live Streaming**
  - Implementing live video streaming capabilities
