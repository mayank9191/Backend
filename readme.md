# Learning Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB

## Overview

I have learned **Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB**, which are essential technologies for backend development. This knowledge enables me to build scalable and efficient web applications using the MERN stack.

---

## Technologies Covered

- **Node.js** â†’ JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js** â†’ Minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB** â†’ NoSQL database for storing and managing data efficiently.
- **Mongoose** â†’ ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js.
- **MongoDB Atlas** â†’ Cloud database service for MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary** â†’ Cloud-based image and file storage solution.
- **Multer** â†’ Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.
- **Cookie Parser** â†’ Middleware to parse cookies in requests.
- **CORS** â†’ Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** â†’ Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt** â†’ Library for password hashing and security.

## What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ **Node.js**

- Setting up a Node.js project with `npm init`
- Handling asynchronous operations with **callbacks, promises, and async/await**
- Working with built-in modules like `fs`, `http`, and `path`

### ðŸ”¹ **Express.js**

- Creating a simple Express server
- Routing: Handling **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** requests
- Middleware functions (custom, built-in, third-party like `cors`, `morgan`)
- Error handling and custom error classes

### ðŸ”¹ **MongoDB & Mongoose**

- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB using Mongoose
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Schema and Model creation
- Using MongoDB Aggregation and `$lookup` for complex queries
- Storing data on **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database Service)**
- Implementing **Aggregation Pipeline** for advanced data processing

### ðŸ”¹ **Authentication & Security**

- User authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- Hashing passwords using **Bcrypt**
- Handling cookies using **Cookie Parser**
- Managing CORS policies with **CORS middleware**

### ðŸ”¹ **File Upload & Storage**

- Uploading and handling images using **Multer**
- Storing and serving images using **Cloudinary**

## Project Implementations

- **Basic REST API** â†’ Created a CRUD API using Express and MongoDB.
- **User Authentication** â†’ Implemented **JWT-based authentication**.
- **Todo App** â†’ Built a full-stack application using Express.js and MongoDB.
- **Image Upload System** â†’ Integrated **Multer** and **Cloudinary** for image handling.
- **User Management System** â†’ Developed full user functionalities including:
  - **Register User**
  - **Login User**
  - **Logout User**
  - **Refresh Access Token**
  - **Change Current Password**
  - **Get Current User**
  - **Update Account Details**
  - **Update User Avatar**
  - **Update User Cover Image**
  - **Get User Channel Profile**
  - **Get User Watch History**

## Next Steps

- Implement **real-time features** using **WebSockets**.
- Learn **GraphQL** for efficient API development.
- Deploy applications using **Docker, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines**.
